**Scan & Serve**

Scan&Serve is a web based application designed to streamline the customer ordering process and help restaurants to manage there orders more effectively.
As a frequent restaurant-goers , we noticed a **consistent pain-point** which was :  the time wasted waiting our server to take our order. Especially when we already knew what we are going to order.  That’s how the idea of developing Scan&Serve came in our mind.

**Module Description**

The Project is developed in 6 different module , 

1. Restaurant Management System : This module is responsible for account creation and management of the restaurant. This mainly included CRUD operations.
2. Menu Management : This module is responsible for adding, creating and updating menu items for logged in restaurant.
3. QR code generation : Create unique QR’s for each table.
4. Order processing : Responsible for Handling customer orders and payments.
5. Kitchen management : Tracking order status on each table , also manage order history.
6. Feedback management : management of feedback given by the customers.

**Tools and Technologies :** 

For building scan and server we leveraged MERN stack - MongoDb for database , Express.js and Node.js for frontend and React for building the fronted.
